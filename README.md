This is an authentication application that also has a counter built in.
The top box verifies an email address as well as a password.
If the email address does not have an "@" symbol, it will send out an error message indicating that the email address needs an "@" symbol to be verified.
Once you are logged in, the top box turns into a "My User Profile" box and you will then see three other options in the top-right hand corner
My Products, My Sales, and Logout which is highlighted in yellow.
The bottom box has a counter enabled with 0 appearing as the default number.
Pressing the Increment box will count upwards by 1.
Pressing the Decrement box will count backwards by 1.
You can also press Increase by 10 button to increase the number by 10.
Pressing the Toggle Counter button will hide the current number displayed.

You can copy and paste files and run npm install then npm start.
